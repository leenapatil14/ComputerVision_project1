#### Image Filtering and Template Matching.
#### Objective Given:
1. The goal of this task is to experiment with image filtering and familiarize you with 'tricks', e.g., padding, commonly used by computer vision 'researchers'.
2. The goal of this task is to experiment with template matching techniques, i.e., normalized cross correlation (NCC).

#### Tasks performed:
1. Determined the size and added padding to the original image. 
2. Used the padded image and given kernel to implment image convolution.
3. Determined the size of each patch to the original image.
4. Perform NCC for each patch and thus implemented template matching.


##### Issues:
None.
